# MongoDB: 
i used **MongoDB**to build Schemas and store the data ..
MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.


# installation: 

i have installed mongoose and some packages for express node js. 

first install the Express in your project folder to build your server 

```language
npm init -y 
npm i express
npm i nodemon --global 
```

now install mongoose to build your database and connect it with server
```
npm i mongoose

```
then install axios to make HTTP requests to the API or Database  
```language
npm i axios
```

the install CORS package ... CORS is providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

```language
npm i cors 
```
install dotenv to give a secret keys to your application 
```language
npm i dotenv
```

# functions:

this is an example to how to get the data from mongoDB 
```javascript
const getdesigners = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    designerSchema.find({}).then((result) => {
      res.status(200).json(result);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.json({ error });
  }
};

```

# PORT 
you need to assigne your port to run your program , example: PORT=5000; 
this PORT variable will be in dotenv file .

# Test
